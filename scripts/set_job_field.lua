-- set_job_field represents a lua script that takes the following arguments:
-- 	1) The id of the job
--    2) The name of the field
--    3) The value to set the field to
-- It first checks if the job exists in the database (has not been destroyed)
-- and then sets the given field to the given value.

-- IMPORTANT: If you edit this file, you must run go generate . to rewrite ../scripts.go
